        Notch, as he is commonly called, was born 1 June 1979 in Stockholm, Sweden.
        At the age of 7, Notch began programming on his father's Commodore 128. Since then,
        he was an avid video game developer, making his first text-based game just a year

        The game started out unheard of, but soon it's popularity grew from a small group to a 
        huge player base. The game's open world and variety of building blocks make it appealing
        for almost anyone to play. Although there have been a lot of additions and changes over the 
        years, the core gameplay is still there: explore, mine, and build whatever you can dream of.

        Obviously, this amazing game earns Notch a spot as one of the best game developers of all time
        if not the best!
